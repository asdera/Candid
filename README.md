# Candid
Inspired by the concerns people have over technologies pushing people apart, we wanted to build something that brings people back together. We noticed people wasted hours struggling to get the perfect shot on parties and events while that time could have been spent on having fun with friends and meeting new people. It's even harder when it comes to group photo as there's always one person that needs to be holding the phone. We were inspired to create an AI camera using Microsoft Azure Face API that takes photos whenever it detects happiness and generates the best candid shots for you to share on Facebook and Instagram. This is especially useful for people with disabilities as placing the phone at a static place is all it takes, and CANDID does everything else for you.
